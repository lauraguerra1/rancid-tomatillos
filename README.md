## Abstract: 
This is a movie rating website that uses the fetch API to display information about a variety of movies. This web app allows users to search movies by title, filter by ratings, and watch movie trailers! To gather more information about a particular movie, users are able to click on the movie and view it's details! The app features network requests to access information about movies and utilizes react router to create a multi-page experience.
